# PIC18F47Q10 PWM Constant on-time

## Objective:
This repository contains an example of MCC generated code for PWM as described in [*TBxxxx - Getting Started with PWM on PIC18*](https://www.microchip.com/) document from Microchip.
<br>The PIC18F47Q10 features four 10-bit PWM generators. This example describes how to configure the CCP2 peripheral in conjunction with TMR4 to produce a PWM signal with variable frequency and constant on-time.
<br>Two GPIO pins are used. RE2 as an input to read the on-board button for controlling the demo and RC7 as a PWM output.

## Hardware Used
- PIC18F47Q10 Curiosity Nano [(DM182029)](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/DM182029)
- Oscilloscope or logic analyzer for visualization

## Setup
The PIC18F47Q10 Curiosity Nano Development Board is used as the test platform.

The following configuration is done for this example:
- RC7 pin - Configured as digital PWM output (CCP2)
- RE2 pin - Configured as digital input with pull-up for button SW0

## Operation

Hook the oscilloscope probe on RC7 and run the code generated by MCC. A signal with the frequency of 50kHz and 1 microsecond on-time will be visualized.
- A press on the push-button (SW0) produces a change of frequency (50, 100, 200, 400 or 800kHz). The on-time is kept at 1 microsecond.

## Summary
This project showcases how to configure the PIC18F47Q10 microcontroller for generating a PWM with constant on-time while varying the frequency. The example shows both MCC initialization of the CCP2 and TMR4 for PWM and update of parameters at run-time.
